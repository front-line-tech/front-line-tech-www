                        There are many vectors
                        an attacker might use to retrieve
                        your sensitive data. Some involve
                        the use of a compromised version of
                        Android, or a malicious app running
                        on Android with enough authority to
                        see your application data.

                    <h3>Secure storage</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        As <b>Aisle3</b> is designed to run
                        on a wide range of modern Android
                        devices, it cannot rely on the OS to
                        provide secure encryption or
                        sandboxing. Instead, it creates its
                        own encrypted data store inside the
                        confines of the OS sandbox - and
                        allows you to persist your data and
                        objects there. Even if the application's
                        sandbox is compromised, your data cannot
                        be decrypted without the appropriate
                        keys.

                        <b>Aisle3</b> simplifies the process of
                        setting up secure TLS connections,
                        the transfer of data, the storage of
                        that data in encrypted form, and mitigating
                        risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

                    <p>
                        <b>Aisle3</b> supports certificate pinning -
                        a way to ensure that the remote service you
                        are communicating with is your own service
                        and that there is not a 3rd-party sitting
                        between you and the service compromising the
                        your secrecy. To do this, <b>Aisle3</b>
                        observes the signatures and certificates
                        provided by the remote server, and
                        alerts the app when it detects an attack.

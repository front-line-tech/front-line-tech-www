                            Front-Line Technology is an independent
                            company focussed on combining
                            fresh new ideas and

                        <h3>Public safety</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our staff trained and worked as police officers,
                            bringing with them knowledge of the front line
                            and the insight and passion to deliver a
                            real 21st century policing service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We want to help you change the way you work:
                            saving time and money - and freeing up police
                            officers to do what they do best: keeping
                            the public safe.

                            clarify your goals, see your product demonstrated on
                            a regular basis, test out prototypes,
                            make amendments inexpensively,
                            and deliver something that satisfies your
                            real requirements on the front line.

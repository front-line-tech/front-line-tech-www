                <p>
                    We are working on a series of mobile apps specifically
                    geared towards supporting front line police officers
                    in their roles, giving them true mobility.
                </p>

                <h3>Savings</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Mobile data can replace forms on the street - saving
                    volumes of paper, and
                    countless hours for personnel both on the front line
                    and the back office.
                </p>

                <h3>Innovation</h3>
                
                <p>
                    We are working on a range of products - addressing
                    existing police function, and demonstrating new
                    value and new abilities.

                    We are dedicated to locating and supporting
                    the great talent and passion that
                    exists in the independent software development
                    and hackathon community.

                <p>
                    In the summer of 2013, founders of Front Line Tech Ltd set up and ran
                    the first UK Policing Hackathon -
                    <a href="http://c-100.org/hack" target="_blank"><b>Hack the Police</b></a>,
                    as part of a volunteer effort to show just how
                    much independent developers can achieve.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The hackathon was a great success, and
                    Front Line Tech looks forward to supporting
                    future efforts, hackathons, and challenges
                    to drive forward technologies that can
                    enhance policing, keep the public safe, and
                    create savings across public service.
